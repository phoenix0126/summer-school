Our summer school students can clarify any misunderstanding.</p>

The other reason is that you are not under as much stress, and in a more peaceful mindset, students can perform better.</p>

                    <p>The most popular reason is to fast track.  A lot of our students fast track and get the credit done ahead of time.  The other reason is to catch up. Students who did not perform well during the school year may consider taking a summer school / retake the course to strengthen the foundation and offer them a fresh start in the fall.  You may also consider taking academic math (11) or advanced functions in the summer, if you have completed the mixed math program during the school year.  In this year, you are caught up and can have a great fresh start in the fall.</p>

      <div class="c-red-section">
        <h3>CONSIDERATIONS ON PROGRAM PLANNING</h3>
        <p>Teachers who are planning a program in mathematics must take into account considerations in a number of important areas, including those discussed below.</p>
        <div class="c-red-links">
            <div class="c-red-link-tab">
                <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="c-red-link js-red-tab-link"><h3 style="font-size:24px; margin: 20px 0;">INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES:<br>Summer School Oakville</h3></a>
                <div class="c-red-link-tab__content">
                    <div class="c-red-main-content-wrap">
                       <p>To make new learning more accessible to students, teachers build new learning upon the knowledge and skills students have acquired in previous years – in other words, they help activate prior knowledge. It is important to assess where students are in their mathematical growth and to bring them forward in their learning.</p>

                        <p>In order to apply their knowledge effectively and to continue to learn, students must have a solid conceptual foundation in mathematics. Successful classroom practices engage students in activities that require higher-order thinking, with an emphasis on problem solving. Learning experienced in the primary, junior, and intermediate divisions should have provided students with a good grounding in the investigative approach to learning new mathematical concepts, including inquiry models of problem solving, and this approach continues to be important in the senior mathematics program.</p>

                        <p>Students in a mathematics class typically demonstrate diversity in the ways they learn best. It is important, therefore, that students have opportunities to learn in a variety of ways – individually, cooperatively, independently, with teacher direction, through investigation involving hands-on experience, and through examples followed by practice. In mathematics, students are required to learn concepts, acquire procedures and skills, and apply processes with the aid of the instructional and learning strategies best suited to the particular type of learning. </p>

                <div class="c-red-link-tab__content">
                    <div class="c-red-main-content-wrap">
                       <p>Students’ attitudes have a significant effect on how students approach problem solving and how well they succeed in mathematics. Students who enjoy mathematics tend to perform well in their mathematics course work and are more likely to enroll in the more advanced mathematics courses.</p>

                        <p>Students develop positive attitudes when they are engaged in making mathematical conjectures, when they experience breakthroughs as they solve problems, when they see connections between important ideas, and when they observe an enthusiasm for mathematics on the part of their teachers. With a positive attitude towards mathematics, students are able to make more sense of the mathematics they are working on, and to view themselves as effective learners of mathematics. They are also more likely to perceive mathematics as both useful and worthwhile, and to develop the belief that steady effort in learning mathematics pays off.</p>
                        <p>It is common for people to feel inadequate or anxious when they cannot solve problems quickly and easily, or in the right way. To gain confidence, students need to recognize that, for some mathematics problems, there may be several ways to arrive at a solution. They also need to understand that problem solving of almost any kind often requires a considerable expenditure of time and energy and a good deal of perseverance. To counteract the frustration they may feel when they are not making progress towards solving a problem, they need to believe that they are capable of finding solutions. Teachers can encourage students to develop a willingness to persist, to investigate, to reason, to explore alternative solutions, to view challenges as opportunities to extend their learning, and to take the risks necessary to become successful problem solvers. They can help students develop confidence and reduce anxiety and frustration by providing them with problems that are challenging but not beyond their ability to solve. Problems at a developmentally appropriate level help students to learn while establishing a norm of perseverance for successful problem solving.</p>
                        <p>Collaborative learning enhances students’ understanding of mathematics. Working cooperatively in groups reduces isolation and provides students with opportunities to share ideas and communicate their thinking in a supportive environment as they work together towards a common goal. Communication and the connections among ideas that emerge as students interact with one another enhance the quality of student learning.</p>

                <div class="c-red-link-tab__content">
                    <div class="c-red-main-content-wrap">
                       <p>Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs. They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with special education teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. Special Education Transformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table on Special Education, 2006 endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for students with special education needs in all disciplines. Those beliefs are as follows: All students can succeed. </p>

                        <p>In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of learning styles and needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest possible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs that accommodate a diversity of learning needs.</p>
                        <p>If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the relevant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative programs and/or courses, can be found in The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A Resource Guide, 2004 (referred to hereafter as the IEP Resource Guide, 2004). For a detailed discussion of the ministry’s requirements for IEPs, see Individual Education Plans: Standards for Development, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000 (referred to hereafter as IEP Standards, 2000).

                <div class="c-red-link-tab__content">
                    <div class="c-red-main-content-wrap">
                       <p>Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning must be identified in his or her IEP (see IEP Standards, 2000, page 11). A student’s IEP is likely to reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. </p>

                        <p>Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the diverse needs of learners. </p>
                        <p>There are three types of accommodations: </p>

                         <p>● Instructional accommodations are changes in teaching strategies, including styles of presentation, methods of organization, or use of technology and multimedia. </p>

                         <p>● Environmental accommodations are changes that the student may require in the class-room and/or school environment, such as preferential seating or special lighting. </p>

                         <p>● Assessment accommodations are changes in assessment procedures that enable the student to demonstrate his or her learning, such as allowing additional time to complete tests or assignments or permitting oral responses to test questions (see page 29 of the IEP Resource Guide, 2004, for more examples). </p>
                         <p>If a student requires “accommodations only” in mathematics courses, assessment and evaluation of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expectations and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student’s Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of accommodations will be included.</p>

                <div class="c-red-link-tab__content">
                    <div class="c-red-main-content-wrap">
                       <p>Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations. Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achievements and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations.</p>
                       <p>It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student’s IEP, the extent to which expectations have been modified. As noted in Section 7.12 of the ministry’s policy document Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999,the principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and the student. </p>

                        <p>When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course, the modified expectations should identify how the required knowledge and skills differ from those identified in the course expectations. When modifications are so extensive that achievement of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely to result in a credit, the expectations should specify the precise requirements or tasks on which the student’s performance will be evaluated and which will be used to generate the course mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. </p>
                        <p>Modified expectations indicate the knowledge and/or skills the student is expected to demonstrate and have assessed in each reporting period(IEP Standards, 2000, pages 10 and 11). The student’s learning expectations must be reviewed in relation to the student’s progress at least once every reporting period, and must be updated as necessary (IEP Standards, 2000, page 11). If a student requires modified expectations in mathematics courses, assessment and evaluation of his or her achievement will be based on the learning expectations identified in the IEP and on the achievement levels outlined in this document. If some of the student’s learning expectations for a course are modified but the student is working towards a credit for the course, it is sufficient simply to check the IEP box on the Provincial Report Card.  </p>

                    <div class="c-red-main-content-wrap">
                       <p>Young people whose first language is not English enter Ontario secondary schools with diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Some English language learners may have experience of highly sophisticated educational systems, while others may have come from regions where access to formal schooling was limited. All of these students bring a rich array of background knowledge and experience to the classroom, and all teachers must share in the responsibility for their English-language development.</p>

                        <p>Teachers of mathematics must incorporate appropriate adaptations and strategies for instruction and assessment to facilitate the success of the English language learners in their classrooms. These adaptations and strategies include:</p>
                        <p>● modification of some or all of the course expectations so that they are challenging but attainable for the learner at his or her present level of English proficiency, given the necessary support from the teacher; </p>

                        <p>● use of a variety of instructional strategies (e.g., extensive use of visual cues, scaffolding, manipulatives, pictures, diagrams, graphic organizers; attention to clarity of instructions);</p>

                        <p>● modeling of preferred ways of working in mathematics; previewing of textbooks;</p>

                        <p>● pre-teaching of key vocabulary; peer tutoring; strategic use of students’ first languages);</p>

                        <p>● use of a variety of learning resources (e.g., visual material, simplified text, bilingual dictionaries, materials that reflect cultural diversity);</p>

                        <p>● use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting of extra time; simplification of language used in problems and instructions; use of oral interviews, learning logs,  portfolios, demonstrations, visual representations, and tasks requiring completion of graphic organizers or cloze sentences instead of tasks that depend heavily on proficiency in English).</p>
                        <p>When learning expectations in any course are modified for English language learners (whether or not the students are enrolled in an ESL or ELD course), this must be clearly indicated on the student’s report card.</p>
                        <p>Although the degree of program adaptation required will decrease over time, students who are no longer receiving ESL or ELD support may still need some program adaptations to be successful</p>

                       <p>To ensure that all students in the province have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential, the curriculum must be free from bias, and all students must be provided with a safe and secure environment, characterized by respect for others, that allows them to participate fully and responsibly in the educational experience.</p>
                       <p>
                         Learning activities and resources used to implement the curriculum should be inclusive in nature, reflecting the range of experiences of students with varying backgrounds, abilities, interests, and learning styles. They should enable students to become more sensitive to the diverse cultures and perceptions of others, including Aboriginal peoples. By discussing aspects of the history of mathematics, teachers can help make students aware of the various cultural groups that have contributed to the evolution of mathematics over the centuries. Finally, students need to recognize that ordinary people use mathematics in a variety of everyday contexts, both at work and in their daily lives.
                       </p>

                        <p>Connecting mathematical ideas to real-world situations through learning activities can enhance students’ appreciation of the role of mathematics in human affairs, in areas including health, science, and the environment. Students can be made aware of the use of mathematics in contexts such as sampling and surveying and the use of statistics to analyse trends. Recognizing the importance of mathematics in such areas helps motivate students to learn and also provides a foundation for informed, responsible citizenship. </p>
                        <p>Teachers should have high expectations for all students. To achieve their mathematical potential, however, different students may need different kinds of support. Some boys, for example, may need additional support in developing their literacy skills in order to complete mathematical tasks effectively. For some girls, additional encouragement to envision themselves in careers involving mathematics may be beneficial. For example, teachers might consider providing strong role models in the form of female guest speakers who are mathematicians or who use mathematics in their careers.</p>

                       <p>Literacy skills can play an important role in student success in mathematics courses. Many of the activities and tasks students undertake in mathematics courses involve the use of written, oral, and visual communication skills. For example, students use language to record their observations, to explain their reasoning when solving problems, to describe their inquiries in both informal and formal contexts, and to justify their results in small group conversations, oral presentations, and written reports. The language of mathematics includes special terminology. The study of mathematics consequently encourages students to use language with greater care and precision and enhances their ability to communicate effectively.</p>

                        <p>The Ministry of Education has facilitated the development of materials to support literacy instruction across the curriculum. Helpful advice for integrating literacy instruction in mathematics courses may be found in the following resource documents:</p>
                        <p>
                          <i>Think Literacy: Cross-Curricular Approaches, Grades 7–12, 2003
                          Think Literacy: Cross-Curricular Approaches, Grades 7–12 – Mathematics: Subject-Specific Examples, Grades 10–12, 2005 </i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In all courses in mathematics, students will develop their ability to ask questions and to plan investigations to answer those questions and to solve related problems. Students need to learn a variety of research methods and inquiry approaches in order to carry out these investigations and to solve problems, and they need to be able to select the methods that are most appropriate for a particular inquiry. Students learn how to locate relevant information from a variety of sources, such as statistical databases, newspapers, and reports. As they advance through the grades, students will be expected to use such sources with increasing sophistication. They will also be expected to distinguish between primary and secondary sources, to determine their validity and relevance, and to use them in appropriate ways.

                       <p>Information and communication technologies (ICT) provide a range of tools that can significantly extend and enrich teachers’ instructional strategies and support students’ learning in mathematics. Teachers can use ICT tools and resources both for whole-class instruction and to design programs that meet diverse student needs. Technology can help to reduce the time spent on routine mathematical tasks, allowing students to devote more of their efforts to thinking and concept development. Useful ICT tools include simulations, multimedia resources, databases, sites that give access to large amounts of statistical data, and computer-assisted learning modules. </p>

                        <p>Applications such as databases, spreadsheets, dynamic geometry software, dynamic statistical software, graphing software, computer algebra systems (CAS), word-processing software, and presentation software can be used to support various methods of inquiry in mathematics. Technology also makes possible simulations of complex systems that can be useful for problem-solving purposes or when field studies on a particular topic are not feasible.</p>
                        <p>Information and communications technologies can be used in the classroom to connect students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into the local classroom.</p>
                        <p>Although the Internet is a powerful electronic learning tool, there are potential risks attached to its use. All students must be made aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible use, as well as of the ways in which this technology is being abused – for example, when it is used to promote hatred.</p>
                        <p>Teachers, too, will find the various ICT tools useful in their teaching practice, both for whole class instruction and for the design of curriculum units that contain varied approaches to learning to meet diverse student needs.</p>

                       <p>Teachers planning programs in mathematics need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP).The OSP is a bilingual web-based resource that enhances the relevancy of classroom learning for students and strengthens school-work connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text, Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service. The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students’ demonstration of these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can use the OSP to identify the skills and work habits they already have, plan further skill development, and show employers what they can do.</p>

                        <p>The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their jobs and adapt to workplace change. </p>

                        <p>Cooperative education teachers can support students taking mathematics courses by maintaining links with community-based businesses and organizations, and with colleges and universities, to ensure students studying mathematics have access to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills they have gained in school. Teachers of mathematics can support their students’ learning by providing opportunities for experiential learning that will reinforce the knowledge and skills they have gained in school.</p>
                        <p>
                          Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure students understand the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies and reporting procedures with regard to all forms of abuse and harassment.

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.

I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

The low student to teacher ratio and the extra 1:1 care they provide really helps bring out the engagement compared to a 33 student class.  My son has greatly enjoyed the course--though summer classes are intense and fast paced.  All the more reason for extra attention during instruction.  We would recommend Victor and his team of instructors for any of the accredited high school programs they are offering.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Given this we put put her back to QE  to upgrade her mark too prepareand ensure she had background for university.  Not only have we seen a 15-20% bump in mark but we have seen her confidence soar because the teacher teaches the content, ensures they understand and truly cares during covid- yes online has been fantastic! Money well spent and calc.will be with QE since public education in math is failing miserably.

Victor reassured us that this won’t be the case with his school. I have to admit quality of learning is outstanding teachers are very passionate and caring. They make sure that each kid in the class understand the unit. The classes are so well organized online and they flow smoothly. We are very glad we signed up for the summer school wit QEA.

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

                      <div class="p-review-card__text">At a time when school had to be done differently, Queen Elizabeth Academy stepped up to the plate.  During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the <span class="wp-more">fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback.

            <div class="c-red-group__text">
              <p>This grade 12 English course is intended to prepare students for university level English, and is intended to foster critical thinking, and higher-level literacy, especially upon the coherent and confident use of formal academic language, and the development of reading strategies for a broad array of texts. The course is broken into four skill segments.</p>
              <p>Oral Communication: This strand of the curriculum focuses on the student’s ability to communicate through spoken language, for example in a presentation to the class, or more generally in the way they answer questions asked of them in spoken English. It also includes the comprehension component of oral communication, that is to say the ability of students to understand and comprehend spoken English. These are extremely important and valuable skills that come in handy in day-to-day life.</p>
              <p>Reading and Literature Studies: This segment of the curriculum evaluates a student’s ability to read English literature and to comprehend and analyze it. Shakespeare will be taught in this segment, as well as poetry and short stories. The goal is to leave with a capacity to read independently, critically, and with keen understanding of the text, as well as to be in contact with works of genuine cultural and literary importance.</p>
              <p>Writing: the goal of this segment is to produce confident and effective writers who can organize their thoughts clearly, while producing strong and grammatically correct sentences. Beyond that the course will also focus on various forms of writing including the essay, which is central to higher level coursework in English and other disciplines. Students will be exposed to a variety of forms of writing, and given the opportunity to develop strong writing skills.</p>
              <p>Media Studies: This segment focuses on analyzing and interpreting media texts, including graphics, sounds, and images. The influence of mass media and popular culture is explored and discussed critically. Students are given the tools to make sure they can be aware of the messages floating around mass media and online culture in an academic and critical capacity, as well as the capability to create their own contributions to that culture.</p>

              <div class="c-red-group__title--sm-under-h3">Summer School Oakville</div>
              </div>
            <div class="c-red-group__text">
              <p>Oral communication is often a strong point for students compared to reading, however some students may have difficulty with it. There is nothing to be worried about, the key to success here is just to be familiar with the English language in general, to avoid slang usage, to speak in complete and grammatically correct sentences, and to demonstrate a wide vocabulary. For more formal assignments, if you are a stronger writer than speaker, try to write out your work before practicing your presentation out loud. Be aware also of how you pronounce words, and the tone of your voice. Avoid mumbling and speak clearly and comfortably. Many students feel embarrassed to speak in front of the class, but remember that everyone is in the same boat and has the same assignment.</p>
              <p>Reading and literature studies often presents the greatest challenge as it is less familiar and more advanced by the twelfth grade than in previous years. High level texts like Hamlet can present unique challenges to students based on the older style of writing and syntax, and it can be difficult to move from simply understanding the plot to understanding analysis and critical study of the text. Break it down into parts and be aware of the components of literature. Write down what the themes are, or the themes that you notice in the text. Keep track of the characters and how they behave in the text. What is significant about what is happening? If you struggle with the text itself, try reading it out loud, Shakespeare was performed live after all, and still is. Try finding a version of a Shakespeare performance to see how all the stage directions are incorporated. Also, try to find something you like about each text you read. While it can be a chore to read these books, they are also classics for a reason. Always ask questions about what you are reading, and always keep notes so you are not scrambling to redo everything at the last minute.</p>
              <p>Writing is a chance to embrace your creativity, so take the chance and do your best. For creative writing, choose topics that you care about or that interest you. For more formal, academic writing, choose topics that you both know about or can research, and which interest you. One key skill here is the organization of your thoughts. That means making sure that you express yourself in writing in a logical and methodical way, not just what comes to mind when you think about it, but structured and intentional writing. Take the time to map out what you will write. For your stories or creative writing, make sure you know how the story will end before you write it, try to develop the characters beforehand, take the time to think. For formal academic writing, make sure to do the requisite research beforehand. Find relevant quotations in the text, and make sure you have relevant facts that you present in a manner that you have thought out. Make use of the time you are given. If you are stuck you can make use of a writing prompt, but always make sure to ask why you are writing what you are writing.</p>
              <p>Media studies is generally the least problematic section for students, especially considering the amount of exposure to popular culture and mass media that most students have already experienced. The important thing to remember here is that just knowing about popular culture is not enough. Students are called to analyze what they are experiencing and to critically examine it. That means perhaps investigating more deeply what they take for granted on their devices, and how they receive information online. These segments are also more dependent upon the discretion of the teacher than most, so material may vary from school to school, or class to class.</p>

              <p>MHF4U / Advanced Functions extends students’ experience with functions. Students will investigate the properties of polynomial, rational, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions; develop techniques for combining functions; broaden their understanding of rates of change; and develop facility in applying these concepts and skills. Students will also refine their use of the mathematical processes necessary for success in senior mathematics.</p>
              <p>MHF4U is intended both for students taking the Calculus and Vectors course as a prerequisite for a university program and for those wishing to consolidate their understanding of mathematics before proceeding to any one of a variety of university programs.</p>

              <p>MHF4U is a very important course for many students because most university programs require this course as a pre-requisite. The skills learned in the Grade 11 course are built upon in this course, including factoring, graphing, trigonometry and exponents.</p>
              <p>Students will likely have varying levels of proficiency when taking this course, as some units, such as polynomial functions, are quite simple, while others, such as trigonometry and proofs. Some students have thus described it as a roller coaster ride of a course, with all the thrills (and challenges) that that entails.</p>

            <div class="c-red-group__text">
              <p>It would be a good idea, before the beginning of this course, to brush up on the foundations of mathematics, such as factoring (especially trinomial factoring), domain and range, graphing, adding rational expression, and trigonometry ratios. If you wait until the course beings, it may be difficult to keep pace with the new material which is being taught. Foundations are always important, and as with all mathematics courses, this one builds upon your past knowledge, so be sure to review.</p>
              <p>Also, make sure to keep good, organized notes to stay on top of the course units. Do not be afraid to practice problems beyond those assigned in the homework, as MHF4U Advanced Functions is known for containing a very wide variety of questions and problems, and therefore the more you expose yourself to such problems, the better prepared you will be. Because of this, the Queen Elizabeth Academy provides all of our students with extra worksheets and practice tests to hone their skills and succeed.</p>

                    <p>In preparing for Grade 12 Mathematics, students must have a solid grasp of Grade 11 Mathematics. Although, what we see is that students at this stage are often faced with the difficult choice of choosing between the Mixed level course and the Academic level course. From experience, we advise students to stick with the Grade 11 Academic Math, as it is a more flexible option. However, the challenge with most students is that the course requires a bit more work. But it also creates multiple opportunities for university programs to pick from, typically ranging from engineering to business courses. So, unless a student is absolutely sure of the path he/she wishes to take after high school, they should stick with a flexible option.</p>
                    <p>Grade 11 Math has several difficult units, including exponents, transformation, trigonometry graphing, and trigonometry identities. This is also the first time they'll encounter proofs. The simpler units include Quadratics, series, and sequences, which are mostly a review of grade 10 topics.</p>

                    <p>It's advisable to build strong foundational skills in grade 10 before taking this course. Factoring (especially trinomials), fractions (grade 8-9 level), Linear systems, and quadratics are the critical skills at this stage. Additionally, students will need a good understanding of domain and range, x and y intercepts, and asymptotes to excel in this course. It is always easier to keep pace with all lessons and course work in this course once the student has mastered the foundational skills.</p>
                    <p>The thing about grade 11 questions is that they involve multiple steps. To ensure an easy flow, you must understand the logic and concept behind each step you take, and then pinpoint why you`re taking those steps. In other words, “what am I trying to solve?” Work through the steps again after you have done this. This is essentially how you demystify mathematical problems.</p>

              <p>This course enables students to deepen their understanding of chemistry through the study of the properties of chemicals and chemical bonds; chemical reactions and quantitative relationships in those reactions; solutions and solubility; and a atmospheric chemistry and the behaviour of gases. Students will further develop their analytical skills and investigate the qualitative and quantitative properties of matter, as well as the impact of some common chemical reactions on society and the environment.</p>

              <p>In Grade 11, chemistry, students will be acquainted with both theoretical and technical knowledge. And they must be grounded in both areas to do well in the course. You`ll find that there are more calculations and equations in grade 11 chemistry. This means that you need a solid background in math to do well. However, chemistry in grade 11 chemistry isn`t so challenging. Besides, it's a good way to see if chemistry or sciences will be a great choice for you in the university.</p>

              <p>In Grade 11 Chemistry, you will be presented with both theoretical and technical knowledge. And to do well in the course, you must be very good at both. There are lots of calculations to be done, but that doesn`t mean the course is particularly difficult. Perhaps, the biggest benefit here is that and the course allows you to weigh the possibility of pursuing chemistry, or science more generally, in the future.</p>
              <p>Here`s a piece of good advice: make sure you have an understanding of Nomenclature as well as how to balance equations in grade 10 science before starting grade 11 chemistry. You really don't want to miss those two courses!</p>
              <p>When you get to the calculations in the course, make sure to lay out all the steps one after the other. You may use a flow chart, with each box indicating your result for each step. Examples, in this case, include the values for mass of a chemical, volume of a gas, or the number of particles in a substance. This is a good way to make problem-solving much easier.</p>

                      <p>This course enables students to deepen their understanding of physics concepts and theories. Students will continue their exploration of energy transformations and the forces that affect motion, and will investigate electrical, gravitational and magnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation. Students will also explore the wave nature of light, quantum mechanics, and special relativity. They will further develop their scientific investigation skills, learning, for example, how to analyse, qualitatively and quantitatively, data related to a variety of physics concepts and principles. Students will also consider the impact of technological applications of physics on society and the environment.</p>

                  <div class="c-red-group__text">
                      <p>Grade 12 physics is an extension from grade 11 physics, except the problems are more in depth and require more steps.  Having good problem solving technique is very important to succeed in this course.  The student needs to understand the concepts and how to apply in individual questions.  That comes with good explanation and practicing a variety of questions.</p>

                      <p>The kinematics and dynamics units are very similar to last year, except they introduce more complex problems such as projectile motion.  If you have a good foundation from grade 11, you will have a good starting point in grade 12.  However, the latter units such as circular motion, momentum can get very difficult.  Electricity and magnetism is very challenging, in that the concepts are abstract and the student needs to do calculation using those concepts such as voltage and magnetic field.</p>

                  <div class="c-red-group__text">
                      <p>To succeed in grade 12 physics, you can't simply memorize the equations and plug in numbers.  You need to first understand the concept, and more importantly, the rationale behind the steps.  One technique we teach is to visualize the problem.  What is happening? Then you can figure out the variables, the givens and the equations.  In physics 12, it is rare that you can substitute the numbers straight into the equation and yield the answer.  Often times you need to manipulate the equation, or combine multiple equations together, based on the situation.  Therefore you need to expect that and be familiar on how to apply the equations properly.</p>

                      <p>Practice makes perfect!  You need to work on a large variety of problems, to the point you are familiar with the patterns, understanding the rationale behind the steps. (i.e. why do you take this step?).  This way you will master your tests!</p>

          <div class="c-red-group__text">
            <p>This course enables students to deepen their understanding of chemistry through the study of organic chemistry, the structure and properties of matter, energy changes and rates of reaction, equilibrium in chemical systems, and electrochemistry. Students will further develop their problem-solving and investigation skills as they investigate chemical processes, and will refine their ability to communicate scientific information. Emphasis will be placed on the importance of chemistry in everyday life and on evaluating the impact of chemical technology on the environment.</p>

          <div class="c-red-group__text">
            <p>Grade 12 Chemistry is one of the most challenging courses in Ontario high schools, and it's the same with Physics. As with typical chemistry problems, many of the questions are based on possible outcomes since Chemistry deals with so many diverse elements (e.g., what is the product of reacting chemical X with Y).</p>
            <p>Many students are not familiar with this type of problem-solving strategy, so they prefer step-based or formulaic-based problems. But science students cannot escape this in the university, so they'll have to learn the skills.</p>
            <p>The complexity of the concepts in Grade 12 Chemistry is high and may sometimes be frustrating. They include enthalpy, orbitals, equilibrium, and organic nomenclature, which most chemistry students usually find tasking.</p>

          <div class="c-red-group__title"><h3 style="font-size:24px; margin: 20px 0;">Tips to succeed in SCH4U Chemistry Grade 12</h3></div>
          <div class="c-red-group__text">
            <p>A vital tip to remember when studying chemistry is not to allow yourself to become lost in details. There's always a ‘big picture’ concept in any given unit, so keep an eye out for that. To help you visualize these concepts, it's a good idea to organize your work into a flow chart. This strategy displays the essential concepts and how they're connected one to another. As a result, you'll be able to handle tests much better.</p>
            <p>Always try to understand the “why” behind every concept you encounter or the reason a concept is essential instead of merely memorizing things. For example, the boiling point of an organic compound reflects the strength of the intermolecular force of attraction holding its molecules together. A good grasp of these concepts will help you adapt to situational problems in chemistry.</p>
