                    <p>SCH4U Chemistry Grade 12 is the key grade 12 course for students going into life science or engineering. This course, in our opinion is one of the 3 toughest courses in high school (the other two being physics 12 and calculus). This course contains lots of application, situation based questions and students are required to understand the concept and apply his knowledge in these situation based questions. Memorizing equations or steps will never work. We teach important techniques to for students to excel in this course.</p>

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education.

                      <div class="p-review-card__text">At a time when school had to be done differently, Queen Elizabeth Academy stepped up to the plate.  During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

She is registered for physics 12 in the fall.  Due to the pandemic situation we have been very worried that our child is not going to get the foundations in math and science that she needs. <span class="wp-more">Thanks to Victor and his team of highly qualified teachers our concerns have been alleviated.  Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.

                <div class="c-red-group__text">
                  <p>This course enables students to deepen their understanding of chemistry through the study of organic chemistry, the structure and properties of matter, energy changes and rates of reaction, equilibrium in chemical systems, and electrochemistry. Students will further develop their problem-solving and investigation skills as they investigate chemical processes, and will refine their ability to communicate scientific information. Emphasis will be placed on the importance of chemistry in everyday life and on evaluating the impact of chemical technology on the environment.</p>

                <div class="c-red-group__text">
                  <p>Grade 12 Chemistry is one of the most challenging courses in Ontario high schools, and it's the same with Physics. As with typical chemistry problems, many of the questions are based on possible outcomes since Chemistry deals with so many diverse elements (e.g., what is the product of reacting chemical X with Y).</p>
                  <p>Many students are not familiar with this type of problem-solving strategy, so they prefer step-based or formulaic-based problems. But science students cannot escape this in the university, so they'll have to learn the skills.</p>
                  <p>The complexity of the concepts in Grade 12 Chemistry is high and may sometimes be frustrating. They include enthalpy, orbitals, equilibrium, and organic nomenclature, which most chemistry students usually find tasking.</p>

                <div class="c-red-group__text">
                  <p>A vital tip to remember when studying chemistry is not to allow yourself to become lost in details. There's always a ‘big picture’ concept in any given unit, so keep an eye out for that. To help you visualize these concepts, it's a good idea to organize your work into a flow chart. This strategy displays the essential concepts and how they're connected one to another. As a result, you'll be able to handle tests much better.</p>
                  <p>Always try to understand the “why” behind every concept you encounter or the reason a concept is essential instead of merely memorizing things. For example, the boiling point of an organic compound reflects the strength of the intermolecular force of attraction holding its molecules together. A good grasp of these concepts will help you adapt to situational problems in chemistry.</p>

                <h3>CONSIDERATIONS ON PROGRAM PLANNING</h3>
                <p>When planning a program in science, teachers must take into account considerations in a number of important areas, including those discussed below:</p>
                <div class="c-red-links">
                    <div class="c-red-link-tab">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="c-red-link js-red-tab-link"><h3 style="font-size:24px; margin: 20px 0;">INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES:</h3></a>
                        <div class="c-red-link-tab__content">
                            <div class="c-red-main-content-wrap">
                               <p>Students come to secondary school with a natural curiosity developed throughout the elementary grades. They also bring with them individual interests and abilities as well as diverse personal and cultural experiences, all of which have an impact on their prior knowledge about science, technology, the environment, and the world they live in. Effective instructional approaches and learning activities draw on students’ prior knowledge, capture their interest, and encourage meaningful practice both inside and outside the classroom. Students will be engaged when they are able to see the connection between the scientific concepts they are learning and their application in the world around them and in real-life situations.</p>

                                <p>Students in a science class typically demonstrate diversity in the ways they learn best. It is important, therefore, that students have opportunities to learn in a variety of ways – individually, cooperatively, independently, with teacher direction, through hands-on experiences, and through examples followed by practice. In science, students are required to learn concepts and procedures, acquire skills, and learn and apply scientific processes, and they become
                                competent in these various areas with the aid of instructional and learning strategies that are suited to the particular type of learning. The approaches and strategies teachers use will vary according to both the object of the learning and the needs of the students.</p>

                                <p>In order to learn science and to apply their knowledge and skills effectively, students must develop a solid understanding of scientific concepts. Research and successful classroom practice have shown that an inquiry approach, with emphasis on learning through concrete, hands-on experiences, best enables students to develop the conceptual foundation they need. When planning science programs, teachers will provide activities and challeng that actively engage students in inquiries that honour the ideas and skills students bring to them, while further deepening their conceptual understandings and essential skills. </p>

                               <p>Teachers must model safe practices at all times and communicate safety expectations to students in accordance with school board and Ministry of Education policies and Ministry of Labour regulations. Teachers are responsible for ensuring the safety of students during classroom activities and also for encouraging and motivating students to assume responsibility for their own safety and the safety of others. Teachers must also ensure that students have the knowledge and skills needed for safe participation in science activities.</p>

                                <p>Various kinds of health and safety issues can arise when learning involves field trips. Out-of-school field trips can provide an exciting and authentic dimension to students’ learning experiences. They also take the teacher and students out of the predictable classroom environment and into unfamiliar settings. Teachers must preview and plan these activities carefully to protect students’ health and safety</p>

                        <div class="c-red-link-tab__content">
                            <div class="c-red-main-content-wrap">
                               <p>Classroom teachers are the key educators of students who have special education needs. They have a responsibility to help all students learn, and they work collaboratively with special education resource teachers, where appropriate, to achieve this goal. Special Education Transformation: The Report of the Co-Chairs with the Recommendations of the Working Table on Special Education, 2006 endorses a set of beliefs that should guide program planning for students with special education needs in all disciplines. </p>

                                <p>In any given classroom, students may demonstrate a wide range of strengths and needs. Teachers plan programs that recognize this diversity and give students performance tasks that respect their particular abilities so that all students can derive the greatest possible benefit from the teaching and learning process. The use of flexible groupings for instruction and the provision of ongoing assessment are important elements of programs that accommodate a diversity of learning needs. </p>
                                <p>If the student requires either accommodations or modified expectations, or both, the relevant information, as described in the following paragraphs, must be recorded in his or her Individual Education Plan (IEP). More detailed information about planning programs for students with special education needs, including students who require alternative programs and/or courses,5 can be found in The Individual Education Plan (IEP): A Resource Guide, 2004 (referred to hereafter as the IEP Resource Guide, 2004). For a detailed discussion of the ministry’s requirements for IEPs, see Individual Education Plans: Standards for Development, Program Planning, and Implementation, 2000 (referred to hereafter as IEP Standards, 2000).

                               <p>Some students are able, with certain accommodations, to participate in the regular course curriculum and to demonstrate learning independently. Accommodations allow access to the course without any changes to the knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate. The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning must be identified in his or her IEP (see IEP Standards, 2000, page 11). A student’s IEP is likely to reflect the same accommodations for many, or all, subjects or courses. Providing accommodations to students with special education needs should be the first option considered in program planning. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated instruction focuses on the provision of accommodations to meet the diverse needs of learners. </p>

                                <p>If a student requires “accommodations only” in science courses, assessment and evaluation of his or her achievement will be based on the appropriate course curriculum expectations and the achievement levels outlined in this document. The IEP box on the student’s Provincial Report Card will not be checked, and no information on the provision of accommodations will be included. </p>

                               <p>Some students will require modified expectations, which differ from the regular course expectations. For most students, modified expectations will be based on the regular course curriculum, with changes in the number and/or complexity of the expectations. Modified expectations represent specific, realistic, observable, and measurable achievements and describe specific knowledge and/or skills that the student can demonstrate independently, given the appropriate assessment accommodations.</p>

                                <p>It is important to monitor, and to reflect clearly in the student’s IEP, the extent to which expectations have been modified. As noted in section 7.12 of the ministry’s policy document Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements, 1999, the principal will determine whether achievement of the modified expectations constitutes successful completion of the course, and will decide whether the student is eligible to receive a credit for the course. This decision must be communicated to the parents and the student. </p>
                                <p>When a student is expected to achieve most of the curriculum expectations for the course, the modified expectations should identify how the required knowledge and skills differ from those identified in the course expectations. When modifications are so extensive that achievement of the learning expectations (knowledge, skills, and performance tasks) is not likely to result in a credit, the expectations should specify the precise requirements or tasks on which the student’s performance will be evaluated and which will be used to generate the course mark recorded on the Provincial Report Card. </p>

                               <p>Ontario schools have some of the most multilingual student populations in the world. The first language of approximately 20 per cent of the students in Ontario’s English-language schools is a language other than English. Ontario’s linguistic heritage includes several Aboriginal languages and many African, Asian, and European languages. It also includes some varieties of English – also referred to as dialects – that differ significantly from the English required for success in Ontario schools. Many English language learners were born in Canada and have been raised in families and communities in which languages other than English, or varieties of English that differ from the language used in the classroom, are spoken. Other English language learners arrive in Ontario as newcomers from other countries; they may have experience of highly sophisticated educational systems, or they may have come from regions where access to formal schooling was limited. </p>

                                <p>When they start school in Ontario, many of these students are entering a new linguistic and cultural environment. All teachers share in the responsibility for these students’ English language development. </p>
                                <p>English language learners (students who are learning English as a second or additional language in English-language schools) bring a rich diversity of background knowledge and experience to the classroom. These students’ linguistic and cultural backgrounds not only support their learning in their new environment but also become a cultural asset in the classroom community. Teachers will find positive ways to incorporate this diversity into their instructional programs and into the classroom environment. </p>

                               <p>As noted in Shaping Our Schools, Shaping Our Future: Environmental Education in Ontario Schools, environmental education “is the responsibility of the entire education community. It is a content area and can be taught. It is an approach to critical thinking, citizenship, and personal responsibility, and can be modelled. It is a context that can enrich and enliven education in all subject areas, and offer students the opportunity to develop a deeper connection with themselves, their role in society, and their interdependence on one another and the earth’s natural systems” (p. 10).</p>

                                <p>The increased emphasis on relating science to technology, society, and the environment (STSE) within this curriculum document provides numerous opportunities for teachers to integrate environmental education effectively into the curriculum. The STSE expectations provide meaningful contexts for applying what has been learned about the environment, for thinking critically about issues related to the environment, and for considering personal action that can be taken to protect the environment. Throughout the courses and strands, teachers have opportunities to take students out of the classroom and into the world beyond the school, to observe, explore, and investigate. One effective way to approach environmental literacy is through examining critical inquiry questions related to students’ sense of place, to the impact of human activity on the environment, and/or to systems thinking. This can be done at numerous points within the science curriculum. </p>
                                <p>The following are some examples: • A sense of place can be developed as students investigate the geological history of their region. • An understanding of the effects of human activity on the environment can be developed as students consider the impact of their actions (e.g., the use of household chemicals, the consumption of electricity, the acquisition of new electronic devices and the disposal of used ones) on the local and global enrivonment. • Systems thinking can be developed as students extend their understanding of various kinds of systems (e.g., bodily systems; our solar system; Earth systems; mechanical systems) and the interdependence of their components.</p>

                               <p>The implementation of antidiscrimination principles in education influences all aspects of school life. It promotes a school climate that encourages all students to work to attain high standards, affirms the worth of all students, and helps students strengthen their sense of identity and develop a positive self-image. It encourages staff and students alike to value and show respect for diversity in the school and the wider society. It requires schools to adopt measures to provide a safe environment for learning, free from harassment, violence, and expressions of hate. </p>

                                <p>Antidiscrimination education encourages students to think critically about themselves and others in the world around them in order to promote fairness, healthy relationships, and active, responsible citizenship. </p>
                                <p>Schools have the responsibility to ensure that school–community interaction reflects the diversity in the local community and wider society. Consideration should be given to a variety of strategies for communicating and working with parents and community members from diverse groups, in order to ensure their participation in such school activities as plays, concerts, and teacher interviews. Families new to Canada, who may be unfamiliar with the Ontario school system, or parents of Aboriginal students may need special outreach and encouragement in order to feel comfortable in their interactions with the school. </p>

                                <p>Students use critical thinking skills in science when they assess, analyse, and/or evaluate the impact of something on society and the environment; when they form an opinion about something and support that opinion with logical reasons; or when they create personal plans of action with regard to making a difference.

                               <p>Literacy, mathematical literacy, and investigation skills are critical to students’ success in all subjects of the curriculum and in all areas of their lives. Many of the activities and tasks that students undertake in the science curriculum involve the literacy skills related to oral, written, and visual communication. Communication skills are fundamental to the development of scientific literacy and fostering students’ communication skills is an important part of the teacher’s role in the science curriculum.</p>

                                <p>When reading in science, students need to understand vocabulary and terminology that are unique to science, and must be able to interpret symbols, charts, diagrams, and graphs. In addition, as they progress through secondary school, it becomes critically important for them to have the ability to make sense of the organization of science textbooks, scientific journals, and research papers. To help students construct meaning from scientific texts, it is essential that teachers of science model and teach the strategies that support learning to read while students are reading to learn in science.</p>
                                <p>Oral communication skills are fundamental to the development of scientific literacy and are essential for thinking and learning. Through purposeful talk, students not only learn to communicate information but also explore and come to understand ideas and concepts; identify and solve problems; organize their experience and knowledge; and express and clarify their thoughts, feelings, and opinions. </p>
                                <p>Investigations are at the heart of learning in science. In science courses, students will have multiple opportunities to develop their ability to ask questions and conduct inquiries and research as they plan and carry out investigations. They will practise using a variety of inquiry and research skills that they need to carry out their investigations and will learn how to determine the most appropriate methods to use in a particular inquiry or research activity. Students will also learn how to locate relevant information in a variety of print and electronic sources</p>

                               <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) provides a range of tools that can significantly extend and enrich teachers’ instructional strategies and support students’ learning in science. Computer programs can help students collect, organize, and sort the data they gather and to write, edit, and present multimedia reports on their findings. ICT can also be used to connect students to other schools, at home and abroad, and to bring the global community into the local classroom. Technology also makes it possible to use simulations – for instance, when field studies on a particular topic are not feasible or dissections are not acceptable. </p>

                                <p>Whenever appropriate, therefore, students should be encouraged to use ICT to support and communicate their learning. For example, students working individually or in groups can use computers and portable storage devices, CD-ROM and DVD technologies, and/or Internet websites to gain access to science institutions in Canada and around the world. Students can also use digital or video cameras to record laboratory inquiries or findings on field trips, or for multimedia presentations on scientific issues. </p>
                                <p>Although the Internet is a powerful learning tool, all students must be made aware of issues of privacy, safety, and responsible use, as well as of the potential for abuse of this technology, particularly when it is used to promote hatred.</p>

                               <p>Teachers planning programs in science need to be aware of the purpose and benefits of the Ontario Skills Passport (OSP). The OSP is a bilingual, web-based resource that enhances the relevance of classroom learning for students and strengthens school–work connections. The OSP provides clear descriptions of Essential Skills such as Reading Text, Writing, Computer Use, Measurement and Calculation, and Problem Solving and includes an extensive database of occupation-specific workplace tasks that illustrate how workers use these skills on the job. The Essential Skills are transferable, in that they are used in virtually all occupations. The OSP also includes descriptions of important work habits, such as working safely, being reliable, and providing excellent customer service. The OSP is designed to help employers assess and record students’ demonstration of these skills and work habits during their cooperative education placements. Students can use the OSP to assess, practise, and build their Essential Skills and work habits and transfer them to a job or further education or training. </p>

                                <p>The skills described in the OSP are the Essential Skills that the Government of Canada and other national and international agencies have identified and validated, through extensive research, as the skills needed for work, learning, and life. These Essential Skills provide the foundation for learning all other skills and enable people to evolve with their jobs and adapt to workplace change.

                               <p>Cooperative education and other forms of experiential learning, such as job shadowing, field trips, and work experience, enable students to apply the skills they have developed in the classroom to real-life activities in the world of science and innovation. Cooperative education and other workplace experiences also help to broaden students’ knowledge of employment opportunities in a wide range of fields, including laboratory technology and 44THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM, GRADES 11 AND 12 | Science research, health care, veterinary science, and horticulture. In addition, students develop their understanding of workplace practices, certifications, and the nature of employer– employee relationships. Teachers of science can support their students’ learning by maintaining links with community-based organizations to ensure that students have access to hands-on experiences that will reinforce the knowledge and skills they have gained in school.</p>
                               <p>Students who choose a science course as the related course for two cooperative education credits are able, through this packaged program, to meet the OSSD compulsory credit requirements for groups 1, 2, and 3.</p>
                               <p>Health and safety issues must be addressed when learning involves cooperative education and other workplace experiences. Teachers who provide support for students in workplace learning placements need to assess placements for safety and ensure that students understand the importance of issues relating to health and safety in the workplace. Before taking part in workplace learning experiences, students must acquire the knowledge and skills needed for safe participation. Students must understand their rights to privacy and confidentiality as outlined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. They have the right to function in an environment free from abuse and harassment, and they need to be aware of harassment and abuse issues in establishing boundaries for their own personal safety. They should be informed about school and community resources and school policies and reporting procedures with respect to all forms of abuse and harassment.</p>

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.

I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

We'd heard great things about Victor and the Queen Elizabeth Academy from friends who had <span class="wp-more">kids take fast track classes.  The low student to teacher ratio and the extra 1:1 care they provide really helps bring out the engagement compared to a 33 student class.  My son has greatly enjoyed the course--though summer classes are intense and fast paced.  All the more reason for extra attention during instruction.  We would recommend Victor and his team of instructors for any of the accredited high school programs they are offering.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

We found the teacher in her high school did not <span class="wp-more">care, nor take time to ensure they understood. Tests covered content that was not taught in class. Her experience was a disaster! Given this we put put her back to QE  to upgrade her mark too prepareand ensure she had background for university.  Not only have we seen a 15-20% bump in mark but we have seen her confidence soar because the teacher teaches the content, ensures they understand and truly cares during covid- yes online has been fantastic! Money well spent and calc.will be with QE since public education in math is failing miserably.

They make sure that each kid in the class understand the unit. The classes are so well organized online and they flow smoothly. We are very glad we signed up for the summer school wit QEA.
