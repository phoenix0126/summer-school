What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.",

During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.",

She is registered for physics 12 in the fall.  Due to the pandemic situation we have been very worried that our child is not going to get the foundations in math and science that she needs. Thanks to Victor and his team of highly qualified teachers our concerns have been alleviated.  Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.  She has been prepared for success as a direct result of professional teaching methods that work.",

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.    Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!",

            <h2 class="learning-s3-intro__title">Chemistry Tutoring in Mississauga</h2>

            <p>Chemistry is a challenging subject. Many students resort to memorizing formulas and hoping to plug in a number to receive the answer - and do well on tests.  Oftentimes the teacher will change the question - especially on application problems, where the student will get stuck, result in poor grades.</p>

            <p>Memorizing steps and equations doesn’t work in chemistry. You need to start with the foundation (such as naming compounds and balancing equations).  The next step is to understand the concept and know how to apply to specific problems. Then the next step is to go through a variety of application problems and learn important problem-solving skills. These are all situation-based questions that you will encounter on your chemistry tests and exams.</p>

            <h2 class="learning-s3-intro__title">Physics Tutoring in Mississauga</h2>

            <p>Physics is a challenging subject for a lot of students. The key challenge is that physics is problem solving based. Students are accustomed to math, where they will have a formula and “plug-in” the numbers to derive the answer.  For physics, you need to know which formula to use in the first place and how to change the formula according to the situation.</p>
            
            <p>Memorizing steps and equations doesn’t work in physics. All questions in physics are application based, they are word problems. This means that your teacher can change the question slightly and your entire solution - the equation you use, the givens, the approach, will be all different.  Understanding the concepts and apply them, instead of memorizing equations, is the key to doing well in physics.</p>

                        <p>One of the important techniques we tutor our physics students is to visualize the problem.  Oftentimes students are too quick jumping into the equation.  This is the wrong approach.  Remember, physics is not math.  You need to first understand the problem.  By visualizing the question, you will know the variables and parameters involved, and what is happening.  Only then you can apply / manipulate your equations, and plug-in your variables and numbers.</p>

                        <p>Remember that physics is more than just answering homework questions.  It can be easy to fall into the habit of memorizing equations and hoping that with that knowledge you can sail through the course by plugging in numbers.  You need to start off by understanding the concept.  Why are you applying the equation in this way?  What is happening behind the steps?  This will facilitate your understanding and you will be able to apply even if your teacher changes the question. This is the approach we use and it works.</p>

                  <p>Understand the foundation knowledge before you start chemistry 11. There are two major components you need to know in grade 10 carrying to grade 11.  They are nomenclature (compound naming) and balancing equations.  If you have gaps in those, you will lose marks throughout the course, because almost every test questions require you to name the compound, and balance the equation to start any calculation. <strong>At QEA, our first tutoring lesson is always going through these foundational skills.</strong></p>

                  <p>When it comes to complex calculations in chemistry 11, like stoichiometry, draw a flow chart to show the steps.  It is important for you to organize your steps, because there are lots of them.  We are talking about the application questions.  And sometimes they can change, depending on the question.  So it is important to put a flow chart on the major step and understand why you perform this step, and what you are getting out of each step.  In our tutoring lessons, we teach these, so you can understand and organize them. This tip is very effective for a lot of my students who score above 90%+.</p>

                  <p>In Grade 11, chemistry, students will be acquainted with both theoretical and technical knowledge. And they must be grounded in both areas to do well in the course. You`ll find that there are more calculations and equations in grade 11 chemistry. This means that you need a solid background in math to do well. However, chemistry in grade 11 chemistry isn`t so challenging. Besides, it's a good way to see if chemistry or sciences will be a great choice for you in the university.</p>

                  <p>In Grade 11 Chemistry, you will be presented with both theoretical and technical knowledge. And to do well in the course, you must be very good at both. There are lots of calculations to be done, but that doesn`t mean the course is particularly difficult. Perhaps, the biggest benefit here is that and the course allows you to weigh the possibility of pursuing chemistry, or science more generally, in the future.</p>
                  <p>Here`s a piece of good advice: make sure you have an understanding of Nomenclature as well as how to balance equations in grade 10 science before starting grade 11 chemistry. You really don't want to miss those two courses!</p>
                  <p>When you get to the calculations in the course, make sure to lay out all the steps one after the other. You may use a flow chart, with each box indicating your result for each step. Examples, in this case, include the values for mass of a chemical, volume of a gas, or the number of particles in a substance. This is a good way to make problem-solving much easier.</p>

                    This course enables students to deepen their understanding of chemistry
                    through the study of organic chemistry, the structure and properties of
                    matter, energy changes and rates of reaction, equilibrium in chemical
                    systems, and electrochemistry. Students will further develop their
                    problem-solving and investigation skills as they investigate chemical
                    processes, and will refine their ability to communicate scientific
                    information. Emphasis will be placed on the importance of chemistry in
                    everyday life and on evaluating the impact of chemical technology on the
                    environment.

                    Grade 12 Chemistry is one of the most challenging courses in Ontario
                    high schools, and it's the same with Physics. As with typical chemistry
                    problems, many of the questions are based on possible outcomes since
                    Chemistry deals with so many diverse elements (e.g., what is the product
                    of reacting chemical X with Y).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many students are not familiar with this type of problem-solving
                    strategy, so they prefer step-based or formulaic-based problems. But
                    science students cannot escape this in the university, so they'll have
                    to learn the skills.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The complexity of the concepts in Grade 12 Chemistry is high and may
                    sometimes be frustrating. They include enthalpy, orbitals, equilibrium,
                    and organic nomenclature, which most chemistry students usually find
                    tasking.

                    A vital tip to remember when studying chemistry is not to allow yourself
                    to become lost in details. There's always a ‘big picture’ concept in any
                    given unit, so keep an eye out for that. To help you visualize these
                    concepts, it's a good idea to organize your work into a flow chart. This
                    strategy displays the essential concepts and how they're connected one
                    to another. As a result, you'll be able to handle tests much better.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Always try to understand the “why” behind every concept you encounter or
                    the reason a concept is essential instead of merely memorizing things.
                    For example, the boiling point of an organic compound reflects the
                    strength of the intermolecular force of attraction holding its molecules
                    together. A good grasp of these concepts will help you adapt to
                    situational problems in chemistry.

                  <p>Quite frankly, Grade 11 Physics can be tough, because it involves using lots of formula, which students are expected to know beforehand. Most of the concepts will be very new for many students. In most cases, problem-solving does not follow concrete steps, as in math. So students will need to know all the formulas, as well as how to manipulate different equations to achieve their desired result.</p>
                  <p>Physics questions are traditionally full of word problems, and that's another area of challenge to most students, because they'll need to understand the questions, interpret them, then extract the given variables and variations. But with practice, even this can be mastered.</p>
                  <p>Grade 11 physics is a pre-requisite for Grade 12 Physics and an important course for students who wish to pursue engineering or science in university.</p>

                  <p>To excel in grade 11 physics, you can't simply memorize the equations. For your own good, it is far better to understand the reasoning behind every concept. Be sure to visualize the situation so you can identify given variables and variations in each problem. Additionally, you want to be sure you`re applying the equations rightly, instead of blindly following steps or processes.</p>
                  <p>The complexity of physics is also seen in the use of several equations to solve a single problem. The trick is to identify what you have been given, note their places in the relevant equations, and identify the variables you weren't given in the question. Finally, use this equation or in combination with other equations to find the unknown.</p>

                  <p>The key factor for student to succeed in SPH4U Physics 12, is to master problem solving techniques.  Questions in physics are situation based, so it is not straight forward as in plugging in numbers to an equation to solve a problem, which a lot of students mistakenly expect.  The student must learn how to derive and modify equations in SPH4U Physics problems, to isolate the unknown variables and list out all the givens, and start from there.  One key tip is to draw diagrams so one can visualize the problems, then identify the variables and parameters in that question.  We teach these important problem solving techniques in our SPH4U Physics 12 course.</p>
                  <p>The second factor is to understand the concept.  Many students rely on memorizing definition without have a good understand of the concept.  For example, what is voltage?  Students will memorize a textbook definition without knowing what voltage really is.  To master SPH4U Physics 12 course, the student must be able to explain the concept (such as voltage) in their own words.  Once the student understand the concept, the next step is to relate that concept to the equation.  This means that the student must understand what each parameter mean in the equation, and how they would change when the situation changes.  Why is it happening like that?  Going deeper into this will take effort and time, but the student will gain the understand and being able to apply them in problem solving situations.  Our course in SPH4U Physics 12 provide in depth lesson, including step by step explanation of the key concepts and their application.  In this way, it is easier for students to digest the materials.</p>
                  <p>The third factor is practice.  In SPH4U Physics 12, it is critical to practice a variety of questions and get familiarize with them.  This will ensure the student to perform well on tests and maximize the test results.  In our SPH4U Physics 12 course, we provide a variety of worksheets for our students to practice.</p>

                              <p>QE is Ministry accredited, which means we offer high school courses. We know the curriculum of each subject inside-out. We know what foundation building block is important leading to the next grade. As we have worked with 5,000+ students over the past 9 years, we are familiar with the common weakness and challenge they face on each subject. Therefore, we focus on what matters most to achieve success. Our students were admitted to top universities: Waterloo, Laurier, Queen's, Western, McGill with scholarship from $2,000 to $50,000.</p>

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

                      <div class="p-review-card__text">At a time when school had to be done differently, Queen Elizabeth Academy stepped up to the plate.  During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

She is registered for physics 12 in the fall.  Due to the pandemic situation we have been very worried that our child is not going to get the foundations in math and science that she needs. <span class="wp-more">Thanks to Victor and his team of highly qualified teachers our concerns have been alleviated.  Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the <span class="wp-more">fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.

I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

We'd heard great things about Victor and the Queen Elizabeth Academy from friends who had <span class="wp-more">kids take fast track classes.  The low student to teacher ratio and the extra 1:1 care they provide really helps bring out the engagement compared to a 33 student class.  My son has greatly enjoyed the course--though summer classes are intense and fast paced.  All the more reason for extra attention during instruction.  We would recommend Victor and his team of instructors for any of the accredited high school programs they are offering.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Given this we put put her back to QE  to upgrade her mark too prepareand ensure she had background for university.  Not only have we seen a 15-20% bump in mark but we have seen her confidence soar because the teacher teaches the content, ensures they understand and truly cares during covid- yes online has been fantastic! Money well spent and calc.will be with QE since public education in math is failing miserably.

They make sure that each kid in the class understand the unit. The classes are so well organized online and they flow smoothly. We are very glad we signed up for the summer school wit QEA.
